# VaccInfectSimMatlab

Overview of Project:
Our project explores herd immunity and hopes to encourage people to get vaccinations 
to decrease infection rates in our communities. Our program simulates how a disease 
infects a population with different percentages of vaccinated and unvaccinated rates. 
It shows herd immunity by showing how an increased number of the vaccinated population 
can decrease the number of people affected.

We model this in Matlab using graph theory concepts. Graph theory is a mathematical way 
to represent the relationships between objects. In graph theory, graphs have vertices 
(or nodes) connected by edges (or lines). For our project, the nodes are the individuals 
concerned and the edges are their connections. For example, if two nodes are connected with
an edge then it means they are "friends" or have some form of contact with each other. This 
contact is a way for the disease to spread. This is why we used graph theory to model our
concept because we wanted to see how disease spreads among individuals that are connected 
in a population.

Our project also involves the Monte Carlo Method. The Monte Carlo method are algorithms 
that create repeated random sampling to receive numerical results. In our project, we use
this method to run our simulation several times changing the percent of initial unvaccinated to
see the rate at which people get infected.
